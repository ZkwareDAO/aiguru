The image contains handwritten mathematical solutions to a trigonometric problem. Here is a breakdown and interpretation of the content:

### Part (i)
1. **Cosine Rule Application**:
   - The cosine rule is used to find \( \cos A \):
     \[
     \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}
     \]
   - Given values are plugged in, resulting in:
     \[
     \cos A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
     \]

2. **Simplifying Trigonometric Identities**:
   - Using the identity \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \), and other trigonometric relationships, the expression \( \sin B - \sin A \) is simplified.
   - The terms are rearranged and simplified to isolate \( \sin C \) and \( \cos C \).

3. **Finding \( \tan C \)**:
   - The expression is simplified to:
     \[
     \frac{\sin^2 C}{\cos^2 C} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \tan C = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

### Part (ii)
1. **Given Values for \( \sin C \) and \( \cos C \)**:
   - \( \sin C = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \)
   - \( \cos C = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \)

2. **Using Angle Sum Formula for Sine**:
   - \( \sin B \) is calculated using the angle sum formula \( \sin (A + C) \):
     \[
     \sin B = \sin (A + C) = \sin A \cos C + \cos A \sin C
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \sin B = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\right) = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{6}
     \]

3. **Area of Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - The area is given by:
     \[
     \Delta_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A = 3
     \]
   - Solving for \( bc \):
     \[
     bc = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Finding \( b \)**:
   - Using the cosine rule again:
     \[
     a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A
     \]
   - Solving for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 2\sqrt{2}
     \]

The solutions are well-structured and use trigonometric identities effectively to solve the problem.
