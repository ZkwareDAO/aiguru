This image shows a detailed mathematical solution involving trigonometric identities and the cosine rule in the context of a triangle ABC. Here's a breakdown of the steps and solutions presented:

### Part (1)
The problem starts with the cosine rule for angle A:
\[ \cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

From this, it derives:
\[ \frac{1}{2}c^2 = b^2 - a^2 \]
\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \]

Then, it proceeds to manipulate the equation:
\[ \sin^2 B - \sin^2 A = \frac{1}{2} \sin^2 C \]

Using trigonometric identities and substitutions, it eventually arrives at:
\[ \cos^2 C + \sin^2 C - 1 = \sin^2 C \]
\[ \cos^2 C = 2 \sin^2 C \]

From this, it concludes:
\[ \frac{\sin^2 C}{\cos^2 C} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \tan C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ \tan C = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

### Part (2)
Given:
\[ \sin C = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}, \quad \cos C = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} \]

Using the angle sum identity for sine:
\[ \sin B = \sin(A + C) = \sin A \cos C + \cos A \sin C \]
\[ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}{6} \]

The area of triangle ABC is given as:
\[ \Delta_{ABC} = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A = 3 \]
\[ bc = 6\sqrt{2} \]

Using the cosine rule again:
\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A \]
\[ \therefore b = 2\sqrt{2} \]

This solution effectively uses trigonometric identities and the cosine rule to solve for various components of the triangle, including angles and side lengths.
